HTML and CSS for personal project
This website was designed for the final project of CALarts Coursera UX/UI Specialization.
I took some courses and did some excersices online from different websites such as FreeCodeCamp, Coursera and Codecademy.
It is not responsive (yet) I am still learning
Maybe I can edit after learning more stuff for making it responsive
